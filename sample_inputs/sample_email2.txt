Subject: Urgent Complaint Regarding Damaged Product

Dear Support,

I received my order #ORD123456 today and Iâ€™m extremely disappointed. The item was completely damaged upon arrival, and the packaging was torn as well. This is unacceptable.

I request an immediate refund or replacement, otherwise I will be forced to escalate this further.

Regards,
