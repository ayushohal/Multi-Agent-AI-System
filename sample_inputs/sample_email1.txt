Subject: Urgent Complaint: Delayed Delivery of My Order  

Dear Support Team,

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction regarding the delayed delivery of my recent order (Order ID: TN-54821), which was supposed to arrive on May 25th. As of today, I have not received any updates or the product itself.

This delay is highly inconvenient as the equipment was meant for a scheduled client demo. I expect immediate clarification and a revised delivery estimate. Please treat this as a high-priority issue.

Looking forward to a swift resolution.

Sincerely,  
Ayush Ohal
