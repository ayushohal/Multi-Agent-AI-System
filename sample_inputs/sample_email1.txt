Subject: Delay in Order Delivery – Request for Update

Dear Customer Support,

My name is Ayush Ohal, and I had placed an order (#98765) on your website on May 20th. The estimated delivery date was May 25th, but I haven’t received any update yet. The package is still marked as “In Transit” on the tracking page.

This delay is causing inconvenience as it was meant to be a gift for a family event. Could you please look into this matter and provide an update on the delivery status? I would also like to know if there is any compensation policy for such delays.

Looking forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,
Ayush Ohal
